TODO:

* add possibility to VACUUM the db, as it seems to slow down or even completely fail the
  refresh_media action

* consider have aboname being optional in action runabo; simply run all programmed abos

* implement more reliable mplayer dumping... allow several tries

* implement also show_abo,$name (show db entries and if file exists, when it expires)

* del_abo: have optional to remove also all related media / also, DELETE seems to always succeed,
  even if the abo does not exist...

* the media tables do not contain the date of the program. Media.xml does but is not dumped into
  the db. Change that in order to define an abo, in which at most $today - $d days are considered for
  selecting programs to download. Could also be another search paramter: --recentdays 10

* fix flvstreamer... commandline works with given parameters, but Video::Flvstreamer fails...

* Think about how to have for powerful constraints, not just "*" which translates 
  into "LIKE", but something compound should be possible, e.g.  --theme "Terra X" --title "!vorschau*"

DONE:
* using IO::Uncompress::AnyUncompress to unzip/bunzip2 media file 
* add new commands in help
* add_abo: make prep statement to insert NULL values
* change prepared statements in add_abo, del_abo in direct do's.
* fix paths such that they don't contain <space>s
* check url: if http run mplayer, else flvstreamer
